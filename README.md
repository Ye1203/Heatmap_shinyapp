# Lamian Helper Package

This code uses shinyapp to generate heatmaps. It can use 09d data (from Waxman Data), segex data (from Waxman Data), and other suitable data.

This will generate a series of data, including heatmaps (original dimensions and print-fit dimensions), processed data, and more.

For further information, please contact Bingtian Ye (btye@bu.edu), including how to build the environment with renv and how to run the content.
